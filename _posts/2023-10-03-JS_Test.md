# What I learned this week #
In this week, we learned from how to use buttons, do sprite animations, and do various coding with data types. I believe there were many challenges past the html where we used a code for the buttons. In my experience it was hard to preogram the switch button. Katie helped me with this code in which we had to mark it down as markdown and use sign brackets to make the code show up on my blog. Another issue i ran into was the printing your about me. In this, I had to remake make code from print to console.log to show in the console settings. Lastly, the issue where all my code wouldn't appear on my blog which was somehow fixed past the weekend. ( I didn't even do anything.)
