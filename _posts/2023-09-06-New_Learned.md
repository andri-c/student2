## What have I learned?
Throughout this week I learned the basics to vscode, I was taught how to create and run my website.

## Slack
A discord-type of chatting system used to send messaged between students and teachers, as well as give helpful information. At first, it was hard to navigate where to make the account, but in the end I found it in the promotions section of my email.

## Github
The mainstream website in which everything is connected. Serving as both the coding system and hub for where everything is posted, it is a place in which we are able to fork different expositories and create our code.

## Kasm Workspace
The cloud server for chromebooks, although it has many flaws such as not being able to drag and drop images, include emojis, and other factors, it works well enough to create the basics.

## Vscode
The main coding system in which you add code such as this to create and design our websites!

## Terminal Emulator
An emulator made for the cloud servers to resemble the real terminal others are able to use, this helps us run our local, or in other words, test servers.

## Simple Commands for the Terminal
$cd, meaning change directory

$make, creating the local server

$clear, clears out the terminal
