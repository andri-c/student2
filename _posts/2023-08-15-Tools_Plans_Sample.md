I was not put in the class for the first week. Therefore, I was instead put into a trio with Katie and Deeshi and was assisted help downloading files. When downloading the cloud, it was a struggle to download the rubies and necessary files to start, but I was able to redownload everything the next day and it all went smoothly.
